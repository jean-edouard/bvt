"""A customisable set of constants

You may get local behaviour by either by putting a module called 
private_settings where Python can find it which
overrides stuff in here.

By the way, "from settings import *"  would probably be considered bad style.
Instead do something like :
   "from src.bvtlib.settings import PXE_DIR, BUILDS_URL instead".
